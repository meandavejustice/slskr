Built for nko 2013 by @wraithan @chrisdickinson @meandavejustice. Didn't finish in the alotted
time so I pushed the repo here to finish it up.

The idea is that you can upload as many files as you'd like into your browser and share them 
with peers via webrtc data channel. Files you upload are stored into level-js(a wrapper around
indexeddb) so when you download a file you are downloading it directly from your peer.

## Quick Start

* `npm i`
* to work on front end => `beefy js/main.js:public/js/bundle.js`
* to work on backend => `node server.js`

das it.
